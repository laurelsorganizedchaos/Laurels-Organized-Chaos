        <p class="hero-lead">
          I’m Laurel — a darkly-inclined, soft-hearted, stubbornly-surviving woman who has had to
          rebuild her life more times than she can count. I’m a mom, a student, a partner, a
          work-in-progress human, and the creator behind Laurel’s Organized Chaos.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-sub">
          My life has never looked “neat.” It’s been a mix of love, trauma, healing, tiny humans,
          mental health rollercoasters, big dreams, and the kind of chaos you can’t always post on
          social media. This space is where I turn all of that into something honest, witchy, and
          hopefully comforting for anyone who feels like they’re simultaneously doing their best
          and falling apart.

      <h2>A Life Built, Burned Down, and Built Again</h2>
      <p>
        My story isn’t a straight line — it’s more like a messy spiral with sharp turns,
        hard resets, and “okay, plot twist” moments. I’ve been the girl who tried to do
        everything the “right” way, the woman who watched it all fall apart, and the person
        who decided to rebuild anyway, even when it felt impossible.

            I learned early how to survive more than I was ever taught how to rest. My nervous system
            has seen some things. For a long time, life was about getting through the day, not
            dreaming about the future.

            Becoming a mom didn’t magically make life easier or more organized. It made love deeper,
            sleep shorter, and everything louder. I had to figure out how to care for tiny humans
            while still trying to figure out who I am.

            Therapy, school, hard conversations, and a lot of nights wondering who I want to become
            next. Laurel’s Organized Chaos was born from that place — the decision to build a life
            that makes sense for me, not for anyone else.

      <h2>What “Organized Chaos” Means to Me</h2>
      <p>
        “Organized Chaos” isn’t about pretending everything is fine, color-coding your soul, or
        forcing yourself into a routine that was never meant for you. It’s about accepting that
        your life might always be a little wild — and choosing to build systems, rituals, and beauty
        inside that reality instead of waiting for a “perfect” version of you to show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, that looks like mixing shadow work with sarcasm, aesthetics with honesty, ambition
        with rest, and motherhood with a refusal to completely lose myself. It’s gothic, emotional,
        practical, and just unhinged enough to feel real.
