        <p class="section-text">
          I’m Laurel — a darkly-inclined, soft-hearted, stubbornly-surviving woman who has
          had to rebuild her life more times than she can count. I’m a mom, a student,
          a partner, a work-in-progress human, and the creator behind Laurel’s Organized Chaos.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text" style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          My life has never looked “neat.” It’s been a mix of love, trauma, healing, tiny humans,
          mental health rollercoasters, big dreams, and the kind of chaos you can’t always post
          on social media. This space is where I take all of that and turn it into something
          honest, witchy, and hopefully comforting for anyone who feels like they’re
          simultaneously doing their best and falling apart.

        <p class="section-text">
          My story isn’t a straight line — it’s more like a messy spiral with sharp turns,
          hard resets, and “okay, plot twist” moments. I’ve been the girl who tried to do
          everything the “right” way, the woman who watched it all fall apart, and the person
          who decided to rebuild anyway, even when it felt impossible.

            <p class="card-snippet">
              I learned early how to survive more than I was ever taught how to rest. My
              nervous system has seen some things. For a long time, life was about
              getting through the day, not dreaming about the future.

            <p class="card-snippet">
              Becoming a mom didn’t magically make life easier or more organized. It made
              love deeper, sleep shorter, and everything louder. I had to figure out how to
              care for tiny humans while still trying to figure out who I am.

              Therapy, school, hard conversations, and a lot of nights wondering who I
              want to become next. Laurel’s Organized Chaos was born from that place —
              the decision to build a life that makes sense for me, not for anyone else.

        <h3 class="section-title">What “Organized Chaos” Means to Me</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          “Organized Chaos” isn’t about pretending everything is fine, color-coding your soul,
          or forcing yourself into a routine that was never meant for you. It’s about accepting
          that your life might always be a little wild — and choosing to build systems, rituals,
          and beauty inside that reality instead of waiting for a “perfect” version of you to show up.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text" style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          For me, that looks like mixing shadow work with sarcasm, aesthetics with honesty,
          ambition with rest, and motherhood with a refusal to completely lose myself.
          It’s gothic, emotional, practical, and just unhinged enough to feel real.
