        <!-- Intro -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <p>
            Let me be very clear about something:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            Trying to stay organized when you have four kids, a full-time school load, an online business, a marriage,
            and a brain that refuses to act “normal” is… a whole-ass lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            People talk about “balancing everything” like it’s some soft, aesthetic, Pinterest moment. Meanwhile, I’m over here managing:
          </p>
          <p>
            – Three kids ages three and under who live with me<br />
            – A soon-to-be 13-year-old daughter who lives with my mom<br />
            – Being a wife<br />
            – Being a full-time student<br />
            – Starting an online business<br />
            – Managing my mental health
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me tell you — this is not balance. This is survival with eyeliner.
          </p>
          <p>
            And after trying every organizational method, planner, app, calendar, and system made for neurotypical humans,
            I finally had to face the truth:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            Those systems weren’t built for me.
          </p>
        </section>

        <hr class="post-divider" />

        <!-- Routines -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Letting Go of the “Perfect Routine” Fantasy</h2>

          <p>
            I used to chase the idea of a perfect routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wake up at the same time. Have the same morning schedule. Color-coded charts. Time blocks. Motivational
            quotes taped to the wall, like they were going to magically cure my ADHD.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, here’s what actually happened:
          </p>
          <p>
            – I’d spend hours building routines.<br />
            – I’d try to follow them for a day or two.<br />
            – Real life would punch through the schedule.<br />
            – I’d feel like a failure.<br />
            – I’d throw the whole thing away and start over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            A “perfect routine” makes my life feel like <em>Groundhog Day</em> — and not in the cute Bill Murray way.
            More like the “I am slowly losing my sanity” way.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I dropped the idea of perfect routines. Completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly? It was one of the best things I’ve ever done for my mental health.

        <!-- What works -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">What Actually Works for My Brain</h2>

          <p>
            Let’s talk about planners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital planners? Notification reminders? Calendar apps? To-do apps?
          </p>
          <p>
            No. Absolutely not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I open my phone with the intention of checking my planner and next thing I know I’m deep into Facebook
            reels, TikTok chaos, or researching something totally random I do not need at 9 a.m.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ADHD brain cannot be trusted with a smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physical planners saved my life.</strong> Actual notebooks. Ones I can hold. Ones I can flip through.
            Ones I have to physically write in — because writing keeps my brain present instead of floating into the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            But also… because I am who I am…
          </p>
          <p>
            I need <em>many</em> notebooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually a notebook “loses its vibe,” or the subject no longer feels right, or the energy gets chaotic.
            The ADHD gremlin in my brain decides, “I can’t use this anymore,” and suddenly I need a fresh one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it logical? Not really.  
            Does it work? Surprisingly, yes.
          </p>

        <!-- Daily structure -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">My Day-to-Day: Barely Organized, But Still Working</h2>

          <p>
            In my house, only three things happen at a set time every single day:
          </p>
          <p>
            – Lunch at <strong>12 pm</strong><br />
            – Dinner between <strong>5–6 pm</strong><br />
            – Bedtime between <strong>8–9 pm</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything else? We take it <strong>day by day</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My morning routine looks something like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Wake up when the kids wake up.<br />
            2. Make breakfast.<br />
            3. Feed them.<br />
            4. Straighten up the house.<br />
            5. Write out my to-do list for the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not a fancy to-do list. Not a prioritized, color-coded, aesthetic list.
          </p>
          <p>
            More like: whatever I remember, in whatever order it pops into my head, written as fast as possible before
            the thought evaporates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because honestly? I have the memory of Drew Barrymore in <em>50 First Dates</em> mixed with Dory from
            <em>Finding Nemo</em>. If I don’t write it down immediately, it is gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I write the list, I also write everything I’ve already done that morning — because it helps me see
            I’ve actually accomplished things and keeps me motivated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tape the list to the fridge, and throughout the day I:
          </p>
          <p>
            – Check things off.<br />
            – Add new tasks.<br />
            – Write down stuff I did that wasn’t even on the list (because that still counts).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some days I finish everything.  
            Some days I don’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both days are okay.
          </p>

        <!-- Burnout & adding slowly -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Building Without Burning Myself Out</h2>

          <p>
            The biggest thing I’ve learned is this:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            I don’t improve my life by overhauling everything at once.  
            I improve it by adding one small thing at a time — when I’m ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I feel confident keeping up with the basics of house stuff and life, then I start adding things like:
          </p>
          <p>
            – Working out<br />
            – Hobbies<br />
            – Business tasks<br />
            – Self-care time<br />
            – Extra study sessions
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all at once. Not in a perfect routine. Not in a rigid way that will burn me out in a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            But slowly. Intentionally. Like stacking stones instead of juggling knives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve realized that setting my intention matters more than setting the perfect system.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know what I want to be. I know where I want to go. And I know I’m capable of getting there —
            as long as I let myself do it in a way that works for <em>my</em> brain.

          <h2 class="post-subtitle">This Is What “Organized Chaos” Really Means</h2>

          <p>
            Organized Chaos, for me, doesn’t mean perfection. It doesn’t mean rigid routines. It doesn’t mean forcing
            myself into systems built for someone else’s mind and life.
          </p>
          <p>
            It means taking life day by day, being honest about who I am, and building systems that match my real energy —
            not the imaginary version of myself I used to perform.
          </p>
          <p>
            It looks like scribbled lists on the fridge. Too many half-used notebooks. Flexible days anchored by a few
            solid routines. Small steps toward big goals. Messy progress that still counts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow, that messy, scribbled, ADHD-friendly system?
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            It works. Not because it’s perfect — but because it’s mine.
