          <p>
            There’s a special kind of ache that comes from looking around at your own life
            and realizing you built something you no longer fit inside of.
            The job, the relationship, the town, the habits, the version of you
            that once made sense — suddenly feels like wearing clothes that are
            three sizes too small and made for someone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            No one really prepares you for that moment. The world loves a glow-up story,
            but it doesn’t talk much about the part where you sit on the floor,
            surrounded by the pieces of a life you worked so hard for, and quietly think:
            <em>“I can’t keep doing this.”</em>
          </p>

          <h2>When the life you built becomes too tight</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes nothing is “technically wrong” on paper. You’re doing the things
            you’re supposed to do. You’re hitting the milestones, checking the boxes,
            surviving the days. And still, there’s that low hum of dread, that weird
            grief you can’t quite name.
          </p>

          <p>
            It can look like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling empty after doing things that used to make you proud.</li>
            <li>Being exhausted before the day even starts, and not just from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>Looking at your routines and thinking, “Who is this even for?”</li>
            <li>Realizing you’re performing a version of yourself that stopped feeling real.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You don’t wake up one day and hate everything. It’s usually slower than that.
            A quiet knowing that the person you’re becoming doesn’t fit inside the life
            you built while you were just trying to survive.
          </p>

          <h2>Burning it down vs. blowing it up</h2>
          <p>
            When I say “burn it down,” I don’t mean impulsively nuking your life at 3 a.m.
            because you had one bad day and a breakdown in the shower.
            (Been there, not always recommended.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Burning it down, to me, is different. It’s intentional. It’s the slow,
            sacred decision to stop feeding a version of your life that’s draining
            you dry. It’s choosing to let certain things fall apart so you can
            stop betraying yourself just to keep the picture pretty.
          </p>

          <p>
            The burn can look like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finally admitting a relationship isn’t safe, healthy, or honest.</li>
            <li>Leaving a job that’s killing your spirit, even if it looks “stable.”</li>
            <li>Letting go of friendships that only exist in your memories, not reality.</li>
            <li>Dropping expectations you inherited from other people’s fears.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It’s not about chaos for the sake of chaos. It’s about truth.
            About not forcing yourself to live inside a story that hurts just
            because you’re scared of the blank page that comes after.
          </p>

          <h2>Grieving the life you’re walking away from</h2>
          <p>
            No matter how necessary it is, burning things down still hurts.
            You’re allowed to grieve a life that was never right for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can miss people you outgrew.
            Miss routines that were slowly killing you.
            Miss a version of yourself who didn’t know better yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grief doesn’t mean you made the wrong choice.
            It just means you’re human, and you cared, and you’re brave enough
            to feel the loss instead of pretending it doesn’t exist.
          </p>

          <h2>Rebuilding in the ashes (very slowly)</h2>
          <p>
            The internet loves a makeover montage, but real life is slower,
            messier, and less cinematic. Rebuilding after you burn things down
            looks like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Doing one tiny thing each day to support the version of you
                you’re becoming, not the one you used to be.</li>
            <li>Letting your nervous system catch up to the changes instead
                of demanding instant transformation.</li>
            <li>Allowing rest, softness, and quiet days without calling yourself lazy.</li>
            <li>Letting new people, habits, and dreams find you gradually.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Rebuilding isn’t about creating a “perfect” life.
            It’s about creating a sustainable one — honest, aligned,
            and gentle enough that you don’t have to abandon yourself
            to keep living it.
          </p>

          <h2>You are allowed to outgrow your own life</h2>
          <p>
            You are not a failure for wanting more.
            You’re not selfish for walking away from what hurts.
            You’re not “too much” for needing a life that actually fits your heart,
            your brain, your body, your energy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes the bravest, kindest thing you can do is look around and say:
            <em>“I built this. I survived this. I honor this. And now I release this.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re standing in the middle of your own metaphorical fire right now —
            or even just holding a box of matches, wondering — I see you.
            You’re not alone in the in-between.
          </p>

          <p>
            And when the smoke clears, there will still be a you left.
            A you who deserves a life that feels like hers.
          </p>
