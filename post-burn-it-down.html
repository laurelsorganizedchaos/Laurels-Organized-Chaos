            There I was — lying in bed in my grandma’s spare room, staring at the ceiling like it had all the answers I didn’t.
            I should’ve been happy. Everything in my life was lining up: the move, the plan, the fresh start, the “new chapter”
            everyone tells you is supposed to magically fix everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except I wasn’t happy. I wasn’t even close.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mind was racing, spiraling, whispering the one thing I didn’t want to hear:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            If you’re getting everything you said you wanted… why are you still miserable?

        <!-- Blame and perfection -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">When Blame Feels Easier Than Honesty</h2>

          <p>
            For a long time, I told myself it was everyone else’s fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tyler was the reason our relationship was falling apart. Sure, I played a part — but he was the majority.
            I was exhausting myself trying to be the “perfect wife.” Doing everything right. Doing everything for everyone.
            And he didn’t appreciate any of it. So obviously, he was the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kids were wild, feral, chaotic. Again — not my fault. My mood swings didn’t help, but in my head it was
            Tyler undermining me, our lifestyle, our routines. I told myself I <em>knew</em> how to be a mother. I was trying
            so hard to be the perfect mom I thought I was supposed to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything was someone else’s fault. Everything was something else’s fault.
            And my part? Tiny. Barely worth mentioning. Because I was “trying to be perfect,” so I couldn’t possibly
            be the issue… right?

        <!-- The realization -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Night Everything Cracked Open</h2>

          <p>
            But the longer I laid there in that dark room, the more uncomfortable truths started pushing their way in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more I replayed things, the more I realized:
            <strong>I didn’t actually know everything.</strong> And most of the issues in my life weren’t coming from
            everyone else — they were coming from me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not on purpose. Not because I was some kind of villain. Just… patterns I’d been living in for years without
            questioning them. Survival mode I’d outgrown but never updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone else’s reactions? They weren’t the root of the problem.
            They were reactions to the impact I wasn’t seeing myself make.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that was the moment everything cracked open.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided I wasn’t going to run from my life again. I wasn’t going to burn it all down and start over
            in a new place with the same old patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I was going to fix me.</strong>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Rebuild begins -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Burning Down the Old Version of Me</h2>

          <p>
            I started therapy.
            I started medication for my depression.
            I stopped blaming Tyler for everything and forced myself to remember the man I fell in love with — the man who
            has always loved me through every version of myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped obsessing over our relationship like it was a problem to solve and instead… we just reconnected.
            Physically. Emotionally. Silly moments. Deep talks. Touch. Presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            We brought our sex life back to life — as often as we could. Not as a “fix,” but as a way to come back home
            to each other. And the crazy part?
          </p>
          <p>
            Our “problems” started to disappear. Not because we changed who we are,
            but because the story in my head finally did.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth was… there were never big unsolvable problems.
            There was a lot of hurt, a lot of fear, and a lot of unhealed parts of me screaming for attention.

        <!-- Parenting shift -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Parenting Without the “Perfect Mom” Costume</h2>

          <p>
            And the kids?
            They started acting better, listening more, connecting deeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not because they transformed overnight into calm little angels —
            but because <strong>I</strong> changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped trying to parent them with some one-size-fits-all script in my head. I stopped using this invisible
            checklist of what a “good mom” is supposed to look like. Instead, I started meeting them where they actually are:
            their personalities, their moods, their needs, their energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped chasing the Pinterest mom I thought I was supposed to be.
            The one who doesn’t exist. The one who would’ve made me miserable even if I’d somehow pulled it off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more I let go of perfection, the more I allowed myself to just be… me,
            the more everything made sense.

        <!-- Coming home to self -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Version of Me They Loved All Along</h2>

          <p>
            Tyler didn’t fall in love with some imaginary “perfect wife.”
            He fell in love with <strong>me</strong> — the real one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The version of me I lost while trying to make everything look right for everyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            My kids don’t want the picture-perfect mom on TV.
            They want me — the messy, loving, emotional, goofy, growing version.
          </p>
          <p>
            By trying so hard to be someone I wasn’t, I was accidentally teaching them to do the same:
            to shape-shift, to shrink, to chase impossible expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I get to teach them something better:
          </p>

          <h2 class="post-subtitle">So… What Is This Blog, Really?</h2>

          <p>
            This space isn’t about pretending I’ve got it all figured out.
            It’s not a highlight reel. It’s not a self-help manual. It’s not
            “ten easy steps to fix your life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my journey.
            My breakdowns, my rebuilds, my lessons, my chaos, my healing.
            My very real, very human, very imperfect life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is <strong>Laurel’s Organized Chaos</strong> —
            not the life I thought I was supposed to have,
            but the life I’m learning to build on purpose.
          </p>

          <p class="post-quote">
            I’m not burning it all down to run away.  
            I’m burning down the lies, the masks, and the perfection —  
            so I can finally build something better from the ashes.
