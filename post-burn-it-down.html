          There’s a special kind of burnout where you look around at your life and think,

          This post is about those moments when the bravest, healthiest thing you can do is grab

      <h2>When “Functioning” Is Actually Self-Destruction</h2>

      <p>
        I’ve had seasons where, from the outside, it looked like I was “doing okay.” I was
        technically functioning: taking care of kids, going to school, being in relationships,
        handling life the way I was “supposed” to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, though, I was crumbling. I was exhausted, dissociated, living on autopilot, saying
        yes when my whole body was screaming no. I kept telling myself, “This is just what being
        an adult is like. Everyone’s tired.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But there’s a difference between being tired and being spiritually on fire in the worst
        way. There’s a difference between normal stress and your nervous system waving a giant
        red flag that says, <em>“Get out.”</em>
      </p>

      <h2>The Quiet Urge to Burn It All</h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes it starts as a fantasy: running away, starting fresh, disappearing into a new
        city where nobody knows you. Other times it’s smaller: “What if I just stopped saying yes
        to everything?” or “What if I didn’t fix this for them this time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        That urge to burn it all down is often demonized — like it’s irresponsible or dramatic.
        But honestly? Sometimes it’s wisdom. Sometimes it’s the part of you that still wants to
        live, begging you to stop sacrificing yourself to keep everyone else comfortable.
      </p>

      <h2>Controlled Fire vs. Total Collapse</h2>

      <p>
        I’ve done the uncontrolled version: ignoring the warning signs until everything explodes
        on its own. Meltdowns, blowups, breakdowns. It’s not cute.
      </p>

      <p>
        Burning it down <em>on purpose</em> is different. It looks like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Leaving relationships that only work when you disappear into them.</li>
        <li>Changing careers or plans that no longer fit the person you’ve become.</li>
        <li>Setting boundaries with family, even if they call you ungrateful or dramatic.</li>
        <li>Letting old versions of yourself die so a softer one can show up.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It’s not easy or aesthetic. It’s messy, scary, and usually involves crying on the floor at
        least once. But it’s also intentional. You’re not waiting for life to collapse on you —
        you’re choosing what gets to stay and what has to go.
      </p>

      <h2>What Survives the Fire</h2>

      <p>
        When you strip away the obligations, expectations, and shoulds, certain things survive
        almost automatically:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The people who actually love you, not just your usefulness.</li>
        <li>The dreams that still tug at you even when you’re exhausted.</li>
        <li>The parts of your personality that existed long before survival mode.</li>
        <li>The values you refuse to compromise on anymore.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The fire doesn’t just destroy. It clarifies. It shows you what’s real, and what was only
        ever there because you were afraid to let it go.
      </p>

      <h2>Rebuilding on Your Own Terms</h2>

      <p>
        After the burn comes the awkward, quiet part: rebuilding. It doesn’t happen overnight.
        There’s no montage with a quirky soundtrack. There’s just you, making tiny choices:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Today I will not respond to that guilt-trippy text.”</li>
        <li>“Today I will move my body in a way that feels kind, not punishing.”</li>
        <li>“Today I’ll spend ten minutes on a future I actually want.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Brick by brick, you build a life that feels more like a home and less like a cage.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        If you’re standing in front of a metaphorical gasoline can right now, wondering if you’re
        crazy for wanting to burn down a version of your life that looks “fine” from the outside,
        here’s your sign: you’re not crazy. You’re waking up.
      </em></p>

      <p><em>
        Just make the fire intentional. Protect what’s sacred. And when you rebuild, do it for the
        version of you who survived all the other fires — not for the ones who stood there and
        watched you burn.
