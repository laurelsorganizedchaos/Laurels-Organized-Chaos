        <div class="post-body">
          <p>
            There’s a version of motherhood we’re sold, and then there’s the one we actually live.
            The sold version is soft lighting, patient smiles, themed snacks, and a woman who somehow
            has endless energy, a flat stomach, and a color-coded calendar.
          </p>

          <p>
            The real version — the one most of us are quietly living — is loving your kids so much
            it physically hurts, while also fantasizing about disappearing into a hotel room alone
            for three days just to hear yourself think.
          </p>

          <p>
            Motherhood without the mask is admitting that both can be true:
            you can adore your children and sometimes want to scream into a pillow
            because the noise, the need, the constantness of it all is just so much.
          </p>

          <h2>The pressure to be the “good mom”</h2>
          <p>
            Whatever “good mom” means in your world, it probably sounds something like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Always patient.</li>
            <li>Always emotionally regulated.</li>
            <li>Always selfless and available.</li>
            <li>Always grateful, because “kids are a blessing.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            That doesn’t leave much room for:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Being touched-out but still needed.</li>
            <li>Having a mental health day while also being the default parent.</li>
            <li>Needing time alone and feeling guilty for wanting it.</li>
            <li>Admitting you’re overwhelmed without people judging your love for your kids.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So you put on the mask.
            You say “I’m fine” when you’re not.
            You swallow the frustration, the exhaustion, the grief over the pieces of yourself
            that feel like they’ve gone missing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Masks are heavy.
            And eventually they crack.
          </p>

          <h2>You are not a machine, you’re a mother</h2>
          <p>
            Mothers get treated like endless resources — of time, of energy, of emotional labor.
            The house, the snacks, the laundry, the appointments, the forms, the “Do we have
            clean pajamas?” questions — it all somehow lands in your lap.
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you slip?
            If you forget something, lose your temper, or let the dishes sit?
            The shame comes rushing in: <em>“I’m failing. I’m a bad mom.
            Everyone else can handle this.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            But you’re not a machine designed to run 24/7.
            You’re a person with a body, a brain, a history, triggers, needs, dreams,
            and limits. Motherhood didn’t erase that; it just made it harder for
            everyone to see it.
          </p>

          <h2>The grief no one talks about</h2>
          <p>
            Loving your kids doesn’t mean you didn’t lose anything when you became a mom.
            There’s a quiet grief that can come with:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The freedom you had before.</li>
            <li>The identity you knew.</li>
            <li>The spontaneity you used to live with.</li>
            <li>The version of your body and brain you remember from “before.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We’re told that naming this grief is selfish — that it means we don’t love
            our kids enough. But that’s a lie.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can grieve your old life and still be deeply grateful for your children.
            You can miss the girl you were and still show up for the mom you are now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grief and gratitude can sit at the same table.
          </p>

          <h2>The rage in the cracks</h2>
          <p>
            There’s a kind of rage that shows up in motherhood that no one wants to admit.
            Not because you hate your kids — but because you’re carrying everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rage at the lack of support.
            Rage at the double standards.
            Rage at partners who “help” instead of co-parent.
            Rage at systems that make it so hard to raise humans and take care of yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            You yell when you wanted to stay calm.
            You slam a door you didn’t mean to.
            You see the flash of your own mother or someone else in you and think,
            <em>“Oh god, I don’t want to be like this.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            That rage isn’t proof that you’re a bad mom.
            It’s proof that you’re a human mom in an inhuman amount of pressure.
          </p>

          <h2>Taking off the mask (even a little)</h2>
          <p>
            Motherhood without the mask doesn’t mean oversharing every detail of your life
            online or never having boundaries.
            It means letting yourself be real somewhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            It could look like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Admitting to a trusted friend, “I’m not okay right now.”</li>
            <li>Being honest with a partner about needing actual time off, not just a quick shower.</li>
            <li>Letting the house be messy in exchange for sleep or a moment of peace.</li>
            <li>Stopping the spiral when you start telling yourself you’re failing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It’s giving yourself permission to be a full person — not just a caregiver
            with no needs, no emotions, and no edges.
          </p>

          <h2>Your kids don’t need a perfect mom — they need a real one</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s something I have to remind myself of often:
            my kids don’t need a fantasy version of me.
            They need me — the real me — who apologizes when she snaps,
            who models rest, who shows them that emotions are allowed and repair is possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            They don’t benefit from watching me erase myself.
            They benefit from seeing what it looks like when a grown-up has needs,
            boundaries, feelings, and still loves them fiercely.
          </p>

          <p>
            The more I try to be perfect, the more brittle I become.
            The more honest I am — age-appropriately, of course — the more human I feel.
          </p>

          <h2>To the mom who’s holding it all</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re reading this while hiding in the bathroom, or scrolling while someone
            finally naps, or sitting in the quiet after another long day, this is for you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>You are allowed to be tired without being ungrateful.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to want time away and still be a good mom.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to ask for help and deserve to receive it.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to be a whole person, not just a role.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You don’t have to earn your right to rest.
            You don’t have to pretend you’re fine when you’re not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Motherhood without the mask is messy and loud and sometimes painful,
            but it’s also where the real connection lives — the kind where your kids
            get to know you as a human being, not just a costume you put on every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            You’re doing more than you think.
            You’re carrying more than most people see.
            And even on your roughest days, you are still worthy of love,
            support, and softness — from others and from yourself.
          </p>
