          I love my kids more than anything on this planet — and there are still days I fantasize
          about dropping them off at the fire station and driving away in silence. Both things can
          be true.

          This isn’t a pretty Pinterest mom essay. It’s about unlearning the lie that “good moms”
          never get touched-out, burned out, or secretly wish for a hotel room alone for 48 hours.

      <p>
        Let’s get this out of the way first: I would do absolutely anything for my kids. I would
        fight for them, bleed for them, take on the world for them. My love for them isn’t up for
        debate.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there are still days where the screaming, the mess, the constant needs, the lack of
        sleep, the mental load, and my own trauma-brain all stack on top of each other and I think:
        <em>“I cannot do this for one more minute.”</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Letting Go of the “Perfect Mom” Script</h2>

      <p>
        For a long time I believed good moms:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Had strict, beautiful routines with color-coded everything.</li>
        <li>Played with their kids all day and loved every second of it.</li>
        <li>Kept their homes clean and their emotions invisible.</li>
        <li>Never raised their voice, never needed a break, never got it “wrong.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Reality check: kids don’t need a perfectly scheduled Pinterest board for a mother. They
        need a human who is trying, who apologizes, who repairs, and who loves them even on the
        days she doesn’t love motherhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        They don’t need you to entertain them every second of the day. In fact, it’s healthy for
        them to learn how to play by themselves, to be bored, to use their imagination, to learn
        that life isn’t constant stimulation.
      </p>

      <h2>What My Motherhood Actually Looks Like</h2>

      <p>
        Some days I’m the mom who’s down on the floor doing crafts, reading books, and making
        memories. Other days I’m the mom who turns on a show, throws chicken nuggets in the oven,
        and counts down until bedtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        I look up activities, I try new routines, I try to be present. And I also scroll my phone
        sometimes to cope. I dissociate. I cry in the bathroom. I snap, then feel guilty, then
        repair and hug them tighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every kid is different. Every mom is different. There is no single “right” way to do this,
        especially when you’re parenting with mental health stuff, trauma, ADHD suspicion, or just
        plain exhaustion.
      </p>

      <h2>Dropping the Mask</h2>

      <p>
        I’m done pretending motherhood is either “I hate my life” <em>or</em> “I’m so blessed.”
        It’s both. It’s all of it. It’s wanting to run away and knowing you never really would.
      </p>

      <p>
        So this is me, taking the mask off:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I love my kids more than words.</li>
        <li>Motherhood has broken me open in ways I didn’t know possible.</li>
        <li>I get overwhelmed, angry, and touched-out.</li>
        <li>I’m still a good mom.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>
        If you ever feel like you’re failing because you’re not enjoying every second, you’re not a
        bad mom. You’re a human mother in a very loud world, doing the best you can with the
        nervous system you have.
      </em></p>
