        <!-- Intro -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <p>
            Let’s start with this so there’s no confusion:
            <strong>I love my kids more than anything in this world.</strong> I would do absolutely anything for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            And also… there are days where, if I’m being completely honest, I joke that I’d like to drop them off
            at the fire department and drive away for a few hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not because I don’t love them.  
            Not because I’m a bad mom.  
            But because motherhood is <em>intense</em>, relentless, overstimulating, and some days it feels like my
            body, brain, and nervous system are all screaming at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news? Since letting go of unrealistic expectations, dropping the lies about what a “good mom” is
            supposed to look like, and basically relearning parenting from scratch every day — those fire-station-joke days
            are happening a lot less.
          </p>
        </section>

        <hr class="post-divider" />

        <!-- Expectations -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Letting Go of the “Good Mom” Script</h2>

          <p>
            For a long time, I was carrying around this invisible script about what being a “good mom” meant.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good mom always has a perfect routine.  
            A good mom plays with her kids constantly.  
            A good mom keeps them busy, stimulated, engaged, learning, smiling 24/7.  
            A good mom doesn’t get touched out, burned out, or secretly fantasize about silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know what that script did?
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn’t make me a better mom.  
            It just made me exhausted, guilty, resentful, and constantly feeling like I was failing at a role I was
            literally giving my whole life to.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I started asking myself:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            What if “good mom” doesn’t mean perfect, self-sacrificing, always-on mom?  
            What if “good mom” just means human mom who loves her kids and is trying?
          </p>
        </section>

        <hr class="post-divider" />

        <!-- Routine -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Kids Don’t Need a Perfect Routine</h2>

          <p>
            Do kids need structure? Yes.  
            Do they need some predictability? Yes.  
            Do they need every minute of every day planned out with developmental activities, themed snacks,
            and scheduled joy?
          </p>
          <p>
            Absolutely not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to think that if I didn’t have a Pinterest-worthy routine, I was failing them. But a “perfect routine”
            isn’t real life. Life with kids is fluid. Someone wakes up sick. Someone doesn’t sleep. Someone spills something.
            Someone melts down. Sometimes that someone is you.
          </p>
          <p>
            My kids have anchors — meals, bedtime, a general flow — but I stopped trying to choreograph every moment.
            The more I relaxed, the more they did too.
          </p>
        </section>

        <hr class="post-divider" />

        <!-- Playing -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">You Don’t Have to Be Their Entertainment System</h2>

          <p>
            One of the biggest lies I had to unlearn:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            “A good mom spends every second playing with her kids.”
          </p>
          <p>
            No. Actually, that’s not healthy — for them <em>or</em> for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kids need to learn how to play by themselves. They need to build independence, imagination, and the ability
            to entertain themselves without a grown-up constantly directing the script.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still do arts and crafts with them. I still read books. I still get on the floor and play.  
            But I also say:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Okay, now it’s solo play time.”  
            “Mommy’s doing dishes / schoolwork / sitting for a second.”  
            “You figure out what game you want to play.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That doesn’t make me a bad mom. It makes me a human mom with human limits — and it makes them kids
            who know how to exist without constant entertainment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <hr class="post-divider" />

        <!-- Boredom -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">They’re Allowed to Be Bored</h2>

          <p>
            Another thing I had to rewire in my brain:
          </p>
          <p>
            My kids do not have to be doing something productive, educational, or Instagram-cute every second of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are allowed to be bored.  
            They are allowed to chill.  
            They are allowed to flop on the couch and just exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning how to be bored is actually important. It teaches them:
          </p>
          <p>
            – How to sit with themselves<br />
            – How to come up with ideas on their own<br />
            – How to rest without guilt<br />
            – That life doesn’t always have to be loud and fast to be okay
          </p>
          <p>
            I still look up crafts. I still plan fun things. I still try to be intentional.  
            But I’ve stopped treating “constant stimulation” like a requirement of motherhood.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Every kid different -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">One-Size-Fits-All Parenting Is a Lie</h2>

          <p>
            I have four kids. They share DNA, a mom, a dad, a family, and some overlapping chaos…
            but personality-wise?
          </p>
          <p>
            Completely different humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some are more sensitive. Some are more stubborn. Some need more structure. Some need more freedom.
            Some need more physical closeness. Some need more space.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no “one-size-fits-all” parenting method that works on all of them.  
            I’ve had to accept that:
          </p>
          <p>
            – What works for one kid might absolutely flop for another.<br />
            – Discipline, comfort, and communication all look different from child to child.<br />
            – Fair doesn’t always mean “exactly the same.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Parenting has to be tailored. Adjusted. Customized.  
            Not just to each kid — but also to who <em>you</em> are as a parent.
          </p>

        <!-- Closing -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Taking the Mask Off, For Them and For Me</h2>

          <p>
            Motherhood without the mask, for me, means:
          </p>
          <p>
            – Admitting it’s hard without adding “but I shouldn’t complain.”<br />
            – Loving my kids fiercely and still needing space from them sometimes.<br />
            – Letting go of “perfect mom” and choosing “present, honest, trying-my-best mom” instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            My kids don’t need the version of me that’s performing motherhood to impress the internet or my own guilt.
            They need the version of me that’s real — the one who loves them, apologizes when she snaps, laughs with them,
            learns with them, and keeps showing up even on the messy days.
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            I don’t want to teach them to wear masks to be loved.  
            I want to teach them, by example, that they are allowed to be fully themselves — just like their mom is learning to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            So no, I’m not the “perfect” mom I once tried to be.  
            I’m just me — and honestly, that’s who they needed the whole time.
