      <h1 class="hero-title">A Chaotically Blessed Thanksgiving (Hold the Family Drama)</h1>
      <p class="hero-sub">
        This year’s Thanksgiving wasn’t picture-perfect. It was folding chairs, foil pans, kids running around,
        and a tablecloth that definitely wasn’t ironed. It was also the first time I chose peace over blood family
        drama — and honestly, it tasted better than any turkey ever has.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-sub">
        Most of my family has decided they hate my husband based on rumors and shit they’ve heard,
        <em>not</em> based on actually knowing him. So this year I made a very clear rule:
        if he’s not welcome, neither am I, and neither are our kids. We don’t split ourselves up just to
        make other people comfortable.

      <p class="section-text">
        Instead of forcing everyone into the same fake-happy room, we did something different:
        we had Thanksgiving early with the people who actually show up for us. Friends and family
        who don’t talk shit, who don’t make my husband the villain in a story they never bothered
        to learn the truth about, who love our kids without keeping score.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Was it fancy? Absolutely not. We had chairs that didn’t match, food in foil pans, and kids
        climbing everywhere. But it felt safe. It felt like home. And for once, I didn’t have to sit at a table
        pretending everything was fine while my nervous system quietly set itself on fire.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Chaos Kitchen Chronicles</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        The day started stupid early, because my kids treat “holiday” like “bonus reason to wake mom up at dawn.”
        Once Nash and Hudson were up, I gave Nash her bottle, put on some cartoons, and started my favorite part:
        cooking way too much food for the amount of counter space I actually have.

      <p class="section-text">
        My kitchen looked like a tornado hit a grocery store. I had deviled eggs cooling on one side, sweet potatoes
        drowning in brown sugar on the other, kids yelling in the background, and that “I’m on my third cup of coffee
        and still exhausted” glaze in my eyes. You know, holiday spirit.

      <p class="section-text">
        We did a little of everything: homemade dishes, shortcut boxes, and “heat it up and call it good.”
        Because the point wasn’t to impress anyone — it was to feed people we love and make new memories
        that didn’t hurt to think about.

        By the time everything was on the table, it looked exactly like my life: a little messy, a little cramped,
        definitely not curated — but full. Full of food, full of kids, full of people who actually wanted to be there.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        We laughed, we ate too much, we went back for seconds, and nobody made snide comments
        about my husband, my parenting, or my choices. Nobody punished my kids for existing.
        We were allowed to just… be a family.

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Choosing Peace Over Approval</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        I’m not saying it didn’t hurt. It stings knowing that some people would rather cling to rumors
        than get to know the man I married and the father of my kids. It hurts that holidays
        come with this pressure to “keep the peace” by abandoning yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        But this year, I realized I’m done sacrificing my little family’s peace so other people can
        keep pretending theirs isn’t toxic. If you can’t respect my husband, you don’t get access
        to me or our kids. Period.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        So no, this Thanksgiving wasn’t traditional. It was better. It was mine.
        It was ours. A tiny, chaotic, blessed little bubble of mashed potatoes,
        laughter, and actual love. That’s the kind of holiday I want my kids to remember.

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">If You’re Spending the Holidays Differently This Year…</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        If you’re skipping a family gathering, changing plans, or doing something “unusual” this year
        to protect your mental health or your partner or your kids — I see you. You’re not selfish.
        You’re not dramatic. You’re allowed to choose peace, even if it looks nothing like the
        Hallmark version.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        May your holidays be full of people who show up, food that doesn’t have to be perfect,
        and the realization that you’re allowed to build your own table — even if it’s covered
        in foil pans and paper plates.
