              This year, Thanksgiving came with a plot twist. Instead of forcing myself
              to sit at a table full of people who believe rumors about my husband
              more than they believe me, I chose peace. If my husband isn’t welcome,
              then neither am I or our kids. That’s the boundary, and honestly,
              it felt good to finally say it out loud.
            </p>

            <p>
              So we had our own Thanksgiving early, with the people who actually
              <em>show up</em> for us &mdash; the ones who don’t feed off drama like it’s
              an appetizer. And of course, because it’s my life, it was still chaotic…
              but the good kind of chaos.

            <h2>Morning Mayhem: Chocolate Milk, Diapers &amp; Turkey Spells</h2>

            <p>
              The day kicked off at <strong>7:15 AM</strong>, when Hudson and Nash
              decided the witching hour was officially over and the “Mom, I’m awake”
              era had begun. I got up with them, made Nash her bottle, got Hudson and
              Nova their chocolate milk (because caffeine is for me, sugar is for them),
              and knocked out the diaper-changing assembly line like a slightly feral
              professional.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once the tiny humans were handled, it was time to start the feast. Since
              the turkey takes the longest, I started there. I seasoned it up, tucked it
              in like a big raw bird baby, and slid it into the oven to slowly transform
              into the main event.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next up: the ham. I wrapped it in foil, set it in its baking dish, and let
              it sit on the counter like the dramatic side character waiting for their
              entrance. Then I pulled together all the ingredients for the side-dish army:
              candied yams, green bean casserole, gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and
              rolls.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because I have zero chill and it’s never too early for holiday sugar, I
              whipped up a batch of peppermint bark. I prepped the green bean casserole
              and covered it, then put eggs on to boil while Tyler took over with
              his candied yams like the kitchen witch he is.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the kids, I pulled out the meat, cheese, and cracker platter, and of
              course added some goat cheese, because we may live in chaos but we still
              have standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              When it was time, I swapped the turkey out and slid the ham into the oven.
              I helped Tyler peel and rinse the eggs so he could make his deviled eggs
              (which, let’s be real, disappear faster than any dessert). Once the ham
              was done, in went the candied yams and green bean casserole while I made
              the gravy, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. For the final five minutes, the
              rolls went in to warm up and complete the spell.
            </p>

            <p>
              By <strong>12:30 PM</strong>, the entire feast was done. Seven dishes, two
              exhausted but determined parents, three wild little goblins we call our
              kids, one tiny kitchen, and a whole lot of love and stubbornness.

            <h2>Choosing Our Own Table</h2>

            <p>
              I’m thankful for my husband &mdash; the man people think they know based on
              other people’s stories, but who shows up every single day for me and our kids.
              He cooks with me, parents with me, and stands with me through the chaos, even
              when others choose not to see who he really is.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m thankful for our children, who drag me out of bed at ungodly hours but fill
              our days with laughter, messes, and the kind of love that makes all the
              exhaustion worth it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m thankful for my best friend Darian, my grandma, and my Uncle Rick &mdash;
              the ones who chose to be here, who chose <em>us</em> over the drama, and helped
              make this little early Thanksgiving feel whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today was loud, messy, and completely imperfect. But it was
              <em>ours</em> &mdash; our food, our home, our little chaos crew, our version
              of family. No fake smiles. No walking on eggshells. Just real love,
              full plates, and tired parents trying their best.
            </p>

            <p>
              If this is what breaking away from the toxic version of “family” looks like,
              then this is the kind of Thanksgiving I’ll choose every single time.
            </p>
