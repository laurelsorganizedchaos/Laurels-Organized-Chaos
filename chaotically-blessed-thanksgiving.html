      <h1>A Chaotically Blessed Thanksgiving</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">November 23, 2025 · Mom Life</p>

      <p>
        This Thanksgiving was… a different kind of holiday. The kind where most of my family
        still hates my husband for drama they never even bothered to verify — so if he isn’t
        welcome, neither am I. And obviously, neither are our kids.
      </p>

      <p>
        So instead of squeezing myself into a toxic family gathering where everyone pretends
        everything’s fine, I decided to host my own early Thanksgiving with the people who
        actually want to be in our lives.

        The morning started at 7:15 a.m. when Nash and Hudson woke me up — as usual — and I got
        up to make Nash her bottle and start prepping food. It was chaotic, loud, exhausting,
        and honestly… peaceful in its own weird way.
      </p>

      <p>
        We cooked everything ourselves: ham, green bean casserole, stuffing, deviled eggs,
        sweet potatoes drowning in marshmallows, a comfort-food feast that would make any
        goblin witch proud.

        Did it look Pinterest-perfect? No. Did I burn my finger on foil? Absolutely. Did the
        kids steal half the cheese cubes before they ever hit the tray? Of course they did.
      </p>

        But it was ours. A real, messy, imperfect, genuinely happy Thanksgiving. No fakeness,
        no walking on eggshells, no worrying about who’s talking shit. Just good food, laughing
        kids, and a home filled with the kind of chaos that actually feels like love.
      </p>

      <p>
        And honestly? I think this is the Thanksgiving I’m going to remember years from now.
        The one that wasn’t about tradition or pressure – but about choosing peace, choosing
        love, and choosing my own little chaotic family.

        Blessed, messy, and absolutely ours. 🖤🦃💀
