          <p>
            Some wedding days start with peaceful mornings, long showers, soft music, and a slow cup of coffee.
            Mine started at <strong>6 AM</strong> with Nash screaming me awake… which of course woke up Hudson too.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that was the beginning of our beautifully chaotic wedding day.
          </p>

        <!-- Morning Chaos -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Exhausted Morning That Somehow Worked Out</h2>

          <p>
            I had every intention of getting up, staying awake, and starting the day strong — but I was running
            on almost no sleep, and my grandma was still asleep on the couch. So I got Nash and Hudson calmed down,
            changed both of them into simple clothes (since we’d be getting dressed in Vegas anyway), and started packing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I gathered all the wedding outfits, extra clothes, and everything we’d need for four days… and then the
            exhaustion hit me like a wall. I laid down on the floor “for just a second” — and passed out.
          </p>

          <p>
            A little later, Tyler woke me up asking what was ready to be loaded. I pointed at a couple of suitcases,
            still half-asleep, and then dragged myself into our room to pack my own bag and his wedding clothes.
            Nova got fed, and she wanted to stay in her pajamas — and honestly, I wasn’t fighting her on that one.
          </p>

          <p>
            I packed diapers, wipes, formula, washed Nash’s bottle, double-checked everything, and Tyler kept coming in
            and grabbing the finished bags to load them. My grandma got up, got herself dressed, and we finally had
            everything ready to go.
          </p>

        <!-- Drive & Errands -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Drive to Vegas — Stress, Searching, and Small Victories</h2>

          <p>
            Once we all piled into the Suburban and hit the road, I started doing the thing I’d been avoiding:
            <strong>finding another officiant.</strong> Ours had cancelled the night before, and I’d been too exhausted
            to handle it until the drive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Somehow, the universe threw us a bone — I found one right away. Just like that, the wedding was back on track.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tyler was stressed because of some issues with his friend, and our original wedding-night plans had to be
            canceled. I wished so badly I could scoop up all his stress, hold him, and make it better. But I kept reminding
            myself that once we got to Vegas, it would start to feel real and good again.
          </p>

          <p>
            We stopped at Denny’s, but they’d gotten rid of the 2-4-6-8 menu and were taking forever to even bring water,
            so we bailed and went to Wendy’s for Biggie Bags instead. Very on-brand for us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then we rushed to Walmart to get roses and everything Tyler needed to make my bouquet. Yes — he made my bouquet.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that, it was finally time to check into the Airbnb.
          </p>

        <!-- Getting Ready -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Getting Ready — When the Stress Finally Melted Away</h2>

          <p>
            The second we walked inside, showered, and started getting dressed, something in me shifted.
            All the stress, all the exhaustion, all the chaos of the morning started to fall away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Standing there in my dress, watching Tyler help the boys get ready, seeing Nova excited and comfortable
            in her own little world — it all felt suddenly right. Like,
            <em>this is exactly how it was supposed to be.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            And the bouquet Tyler made me? The most beautiful bouquet I’ve ever seen. Not store-bought. Not pre-assembled.
            Made by hand, by the man I was about to marry.
          </p>

        <!-- Flamingo -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Flamingo — Pink Glow, Palm Trees, and Pure Magic</h2>

          <p>
            We hopped back into the Suburban and drove to the Flamingo to meet the officiant. Tyler had picked out
            the ceremony spot ahead of time, and when I saw it in person, it was even more perfect than the pictures.
          </p>

          <p>
            The soft lights, the greenery, the Flamingo sign glowing pink — it felt like the city was wrapping itself
            around our little family moment.
          </p>

        <!-- Ceremony -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Our Ceremony — Perfect, Emotional, and Completely Ours</h2>

          <p>
            When the officiant started speaking, everything around me seemed to soften. I could feel the night air,
            hear the water, see the lights — but inside, everything went calm and warm.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was so happy I could’ve cried. Every moment felt sacred. Every detail felt exactly right. Even the kids
            were doing amazing, which honestly felt like its own kind of miracle.
          </p>

          <p>
            And when Tyler and I kissed for the first time as husband and wife, I knew with absolute certainty that I
            would never regret marrying this man. Not for a second. Not in any universe.
          </p>

        <!-- Fountain Photos -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Fountain Photos, Tired Kids & Real-Life Magic</h2>

          <p>
            After the ceremony, we took photos around the Flamingo — at the rock wall, in the gardens, and by the
            flamingo fountains. The kids were tired, wiggly, and absolutely over it at times, but honestly, that’s what
            makes the pictures so real and perfect to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vegas lights were glowing, the fountains were lit up, and our little family was right in the middle of it,
            existing in this strange mix of chaos and quiet happiness.

          <p>
            Our wedding wasn’t traditional. It wasn’t quiet. It wasn’t flawless.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was <strong>us</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I married the love of my dark, chaotic heart — the man who loves our kids fiercely, loves me through every
            version of myself, and stands beside me no matter how messy life gets.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the moment he kissed me as his wife, I knew:
          </p>

          <p class="post-quote">
            This is my forever. This is my home. This is our beginning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here’s to 11/11/2025 — the day everything finally, beautifully, officially fell into place.
