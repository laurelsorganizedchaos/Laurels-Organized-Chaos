          11/11 has always been our date. Of course our wedding day wasn’t going to be calm or tidy.
          It was going to be exactly like us: chaotic, emotional, a little dark, and weirdly magical.

          This is my side of the story — from waking up exhausted and stressed, to standing in front

      <p>
        The morning of our wedding did not start soft or dreamy. I woke up already exhausted,
        staring down a to-do list that felt way too long for someone who was supposed to be “the
        bride.” We still had to get everything ready to drive to Vegas, make sure we had all the
        kids’ stuff, and find a new officiant on top of it. Romance, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath the stress, though, there was this steady, glowing thread of excitement. No
        matter how messy the day looked, we were finally getting married. On our day. 11/11. That
        number has always felt like a little wink from the universe, and now it was officially ours.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Somehow both exhausted and glowing — all of us together at the Flamingo.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Stress, Logistics, and So Many Feelings</h2>

      <p>
        The first part of the day was pure logistics: feeding kids, packing clothes, making sure
        nobody’s nice outfit got destroyed before we even left, double-checking directions,
        paperwork, all of it. Wedding or not, the tiny humans still needed snacks, naps, and
        clean diapers.
      </p>

      <p>
        On top of that, there was the mental mess. I was happy, excited, and also anxious that
        outside drama and other people’s issues might somehow leak into our day. I hated the idea
        of anything or anyone ruining this for you. I wanted you to feel completely loved and
        celebrated, not weighed down.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were plans that changed, things that didn’t go the way we thought they would,
        little pieces of the night we had to quietly let go of. And still, underneath all the
        shifting, there was this solid knowing: <em>we’re still getting married</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Ready: From Nerves to Excitement</h2>

      <p>
        Once we finally got to Vegas and it was time to actually get ready, everything felt very
        real. Showers, makeup, outfits, tiny formal clothes on tiny people who do not care that
        this is a “big day.” My nerves were loud, but so was the excitement.
      </p>

      <figure class="post-photo">

        <figcaption>Pink dress, black boots, and the little crew that made our wedding day ours.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        And then there was the bouquet. You making my bouquet by hand will always be one of my
        favorite parts of this whole story. It wasn’t something a stranger threw together in a
        shop — it was you, choosing the flowers, building it piece by piece for me. When you gave
        it to me, it felt like a love letter I could hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time we were fully ready, something in me shifted. The anxiety stepped back and
        the joy stepped forward. I wasn’t thinking about who wasn’t there or what almost went
        wrong anymore. I was thinking: <em>I get to marry you tonight.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Flamingos, Neon, and Our Little Dark Fairytale</h2>

      <p>
        Vegas at night is its own kind of spell — neon lights, chaos everywhere, people rushing
        in and out of hotels, all of it loud and alive. We ended up outside the Flamingo, surrounded
        by pink light, fountains, and these ridiculous flamingo statues that somehow matched my
        dress perfectly.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Pink lights, fountain magic, and the kind of happiness you can’t fake.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The kids were their full chaotic selves — curious, wiggly, tired, excited, all at once.
        It wasn’t some quiet, elegant ceremony in a cathedral. It was us trying to keep everyone
        semi-clean and mostly upright while also having this huge emotional moment together.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Not picture-perfect — just perfectly us.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>The Moment That Actually Mattered</h2>

      <p>
        When it came down to the actual ceremony, it was small and intimate. No giant crowd, no
        over-the-top decorations, just us committing to this life we’re building — with the kids,
        the history, the scars, the mess, and the love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing there with you, I felt this mix of calm and electric joy. After everything we’ve
        been through, all the times life tried to knock us sideways, we were still here. Still
        choosing each other. Still saying “yes,” on purpose, in front of the world (and some very
        dramatic flamingos).
      </p>

        <img src="images/weddingphoto9.jpg" alt="Family sitting together in front of the hotel and flamingo fountain at night." />
        <figcaption>The moment it really sank in: we are officially a family, in every sense.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Why 11/11 Means Even More Now</h2>

      <p>
        11/11 isn’t just a cute date on our marriage certificate. It’s our reminder that through
        exhaustion, depression, outside opinions, last-minute chaos, and everything in between,
        we still chose this. We chose each other. We chose this family. We chose to build something
        of our own, even when it didn’t look like anyone else’s version of “perfect.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Our wedding day will probably never end up on some wedding inspo board, and honestly, I’m
        glad. It wasn’t a performance. It was real. It was messy and loud and pink and full of
        kids and nerves and laughter and so much love.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        It was exactly what it was meant to be: a dark little Vegas fairytale where two tired,
        stubborn, soft-hearted people looked at each other and said, “Yep. It’s you. It’s always
        been you. And I’m in this — chaos and all.”
