          11/11 has always been our date. It was never going to be a traditional, perfectly planned
          wedding — it was going to be ours: chaotic, emotional, and weirdly magical.

          This is my side of the story: exhaustion, last-minute officiant drama, cancelled plans,

      <p>
        The morning of our wedding I woke up already exhausted. We still had to get everything
        ready to drive to Vegas, figure out a new officiant, and try to keep the day from
        completely derailing before it even started. It wasn’t some calm, spa-morning-in-a-robe
        situation. It was very much: <em>“Okay, we’re doing this, even if everything is on fire.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath all the stress, I was still so ridiculously happy. We were finally getting
        married, on our date — 11/11. That meant more to me than any fancy venue ever could.
      </p>

      <h2>Last-Minute Chaos</h2>

      <p>
        There was officiant drama. There were schedule changes. There was the constant feeling of
        “is something else going to go wrong?” On top of that, I was worried about outside people
        and their issues, and how it might affect your day. I wanted so badly to protect your
        happiness, even when I couldn’t control everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were also plans that didn’t happen — things we thought might be part of the night
        that got cancelled last minute. Part of me was relieved. Part of me was disappointed for
        you because I knew how excited you were. That’s the weird thing about love: you can hold
        conflicting feelings at the same time and still be all-in.
      </p>

      <h2>From Nerves to Pure Excitement</h2>

      <p>
        Once we were finally showered, dressed, and ready, something in me shifted. The nerves
        melted into pure excitement. Suddenly it wasn’t about who cancelled, who didn’t support us,
        or what almost went wrong. It was about you and me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing the bouquet you made me — with your own hands — just hit different. It wasn’t some
        generic florist thing. It was you, taking the time to create something beautiful for me.
        It made my heart feel so full and so seen.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Dark Little Fairytale</h2>

      <p>
        The actual ceremony wasn’t huge or over-the-top. It was intimate, emotional, and exactly
        the kind of imperfect magic that fits us. After everything we’ve been through, standing
        there with you and saying “yes” felt like choosing each other all over again — on purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember looking at you and feeling this mix of calm and wild happiness, like:
        <em>“We really did it. We made it here. We survived all of that and still chose this.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Our wedding night wasn’t some Hollywood fantasy, but it was ours. A little messy, very
        honest, full of love, and threaded with that dark, sarcastic humor that we live on.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Day Matters So Much</h2>

      <p>
        11/11 isn’t just a date on a marriage certificate to me. It’s a reminder that through
        exhaustion, depression, outside opinions, and pure chaos, we kept choosing each other.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        This wasn’t the kind of wedding people put on Pinterest. It was the kind you remember in
        your bones — because of how it felt, not how it looked. And I wouldn’t trade that for
        anything.
