        I am sharing my personal experience so others can make informed choices. What follows is
        exactly what happened to me, in my own words.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Article body -->
    <article>
      <h2>Owning My Part (Because I’m Not Here to Pretend)</h2>

      <p>
        Let me start with this: I know my teeth didn’t end up in bad shape overnight. I’m not
        pretending I did everything right. Years of stress, kids, mental health, survival mode,
        and putting myself last all caught up to me. By the time I went in, it was past the point
        of simple fixes.
      </p>

      <p>
        So yes — needing my top teeth removed was partly my fault. I take responsibility for that.
        What I <em>don’t</em> take responsibility for is what this office did next.
      </p>

      <h2>The Consultation That Actually Felt Hopeful</h2>

      <p>
        In September, I went to Value Dental of Reno to see what my options were. The dentist was
        actually super nice. He was kind, explained things clearly, and I genuinely felt like I was
        being listened to instead of judged.
      </p>

      <p>
        We went over everything and landed on a plan:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>All of my top teeth needed to be removed.</li>
        <li>I would eventually have a partial on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Because I had an implant tooth, I needed to see an oral surgeon.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The office sent the referral, and the plan was simple: I’d go to the oral surgeon, see what
        they could do, then call Value Dental back and we’d move forward with impressions for
        dentures.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, everything seemed fine. I was nervous, but hopeful. It felt like,
        <em>“Okay, this sucks, but at least we have a plan.”</em>
      </p>

      <h2>The Surgery & the Delayed Denture Plan</h2>

      <p>
        I went to the oral surgeon, talked through options, and decided to go with delayed dentures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why delayed? Because:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I have three kids.</li>
        <li>Finding childcare for multiple appointments is a whole Olympic event.</li>
        <li>I needed something that made sense for my actual life, not some ideal schedule.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        On September 30th, I had all of my top teeth removed. It was painful. It was emotional. It
        was a big deal. But I did it, because I thought we had a full plan in place and that I
        wouldn’t be left hanging.
      </p>

      <h2>And Then… They Just Stopped Answering</h2>

      <p>
        As soon as I could talk like a semi-normal human again, I did what I was supposed to do:
        I called Value Dental to schedule my impressions for dentures.
      </p>

      <p>
        They didn’t answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, people get busy. Offices have off days. I left space. I called again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still no answer. No call back. No “Hey, we’re swamped, we’ll get you in soon.” Nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I kept trying. I left time between calls. I wasn’t calling every five minutes — I was
        giving them the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, I’m healing from major oral surgery,
        missing all my top teeth, waiting for the next step of a process <em>they</em> helped set
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        And they were just… gone.
      </p>

      <h2>Ghosted by a Dental Office</h2>

      <p>
        Weeks went by. No response. No callback. No “We’re behind.” No “We need to reschedule.”
        Just silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, about a month later, I call again and hear a new voicemail saying they’re now only
        open two days a week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cool. Great. But here’s the thing: even if you change your hours, you don’t get to ignore
        patients who are literally mid-treatment and depending on you to function like an actual
        healthcare office.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of writing this, it’s been close to two months. I have not heard back from them. Not a
        single returned call. Not a follow-up. Nothing.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Isn’t “Just Inconvenient” — It’s Harmful</h2>

      <p>
        This isn’t like a nail salon never calling you back about an appointment. This is dental
        care. This is someone’s mouth, health, confidence, ability to eat, and ability to exist in
        public without feeling like a walking before-and-after photo.
      </p>

      <p>
        I followed the plan. I went to the surgeon. I got the extractions. I did the hard part.
        And then the office that I was supposed to go back to completely disappeared on me.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s more than just unprofessional. It’s cruel. It left me in limbo, trying to figure
        out next steps with no guidance from the people who were supposed to be part of my care
        team.
      </p>

      <h2>Would I Recommend Value Dental of Reno?</h2>

      <p>
        Absolutely not.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t care how nice the website looks or what their hours say or how friendly someone
        might seem the first time. My experience was this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Good first visit.</li>
        <li>Clear plan made.</li>
        <li>Major dental work done.</li>
        <li>Then completely ghosted when I tried to move forward with dentures.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am sharing my story because I don’t want anyone else to be blindsided the way I was.
        You deserve a dental office that answers the phone, calls you back, and doesn’t vanish
        once things get complicated.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        If you’re in Reno and looking for dental care, my honest opinion is this: for your own
        sanity, your own healing, and your own safety — go literally anywhere else.
      </em></p>
