    <p>
      I have been going to <strong>Grassroots Books</strong> in Reno, NV for about ten years now, and honestly,
      they are one of my favorite places on earth. I’ve scored books, movies, random treasures, and of course
      done their famous <strong>$5 bag sale</strong> more than once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Life got wild (shocking, I know), and it ended up being a little over five years since I’d been there.
      But on <strong>Sunday, 11/23/25</strong>, I finally made it back for their bag sale — and what’s even more
      badass now is that they do it <strong>EVERY SUNDAY</strong>. The bags are provided by them, which is amazing
      because that is one less thing I have to remember to grab while getting kids out the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Darian, the kids, and I had an absolute blast digging through stacks of books. I went in “just to look”
      (we all know that’s a lie) and walked out with <strong>two completely packed bags</strong> — one bag full of
      books just for me and another bag stuffed with kids’ books. That’s a whole lot of stories, adventures, and
      quiet-time bribery for $10.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my favorite things about Grassroots is that it doesn’t feel fancy or intimidating. It feels like
      a place where real people actually read real books. You’ve got hardcore book nerds, kids picking out
      their first chapter books, chaotic moms like me trying to look organized, and everyone in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also give out <strong>free book coupons</strong>. You can bring them in and you — plus everyone in
      your group — can each get a free book from the bag sale area. Free books, cheap books, and tons of
      options? That’s my love language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grassroots isn’t just about selling books either; they’re big on getting books into kids’ hands and
      supporting literacy in the community. You can feel that energy when you’re there — it’s not just a store,
      it’s like a little book universe built by people who genuinely care.
    </p>

    <p>
      So yes, I will absolutely scream about this place any chance I get. If you’re in or near Reno and you
      love books even a little bit, you need to go. I officially give Grassroots Books a
      <strong>1,000,000/100</strong> and will die on this hill.
