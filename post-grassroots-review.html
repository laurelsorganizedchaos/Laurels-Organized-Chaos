            I have been going to <strong>Grassroots Books</strong> in Reno, NV for about ten
            years now, and honestly, they are one of my favorite places on earth. I’ve
            scored books, movies, random treasures, and of course done their famous
            <strong>$5 bag sale</strong> more than once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life got wild (shocking, I know), and it ended up being a little over five
            years since I’d been there. But on <strong>Sunday, 11/23/25</strong>, I finally
            made it back for their bag sale — and what’s even more badass now is that they
            do it <strong>EVERY SUNDAY</strong>. The bags are provided by them, which is
            amazing because that is one less thing I have to remember to grab while
            getting kids out the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Darian, the kids, and I had an absolute blast digging through stacks of books.
            I went in “just to look” (we all know that’s a lie) and walked out with
            <strong>two completely packed bags</strong> — one bag full of books just for me
            and another bag stuffed with kids’ books. That’s a whole lot of stories,
            adventures, and quiet-time bribery for $10.

      <h2>Why Grassroots Books Has My Whole Heart</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite things about Grassroots is that it doesn’t feel fancy or
        intimidating. It feels like a place where real people actually read real books.
        You’ve got hardcore book nerds, kids picking out their first chapter books,
        chaotic moms like me trying to look organized, and everyone in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also give out <strong>free book coupons</strong>. You can bring them in and
        you — plus everyone in your group — can each get a free book from the bag sale
        area. Free books, cheap books, and tons of options? That’s my love language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grassroots isn’t just about selling books either; they’re big on getting books
        into kids’ hands and supporting literacy in the community. You can feel that
        energy when you’re there — it’s not just a store, it’s like a little book universe
        built by people who genuinely care.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yes, I will absolutely scream about this place any chance I get. If you’re in
        or near Reno and you love books even a little bit, you need to go. I officially
        give Grassroots Books a <strong>1,000,000/100</strong> and will die on this hill.
