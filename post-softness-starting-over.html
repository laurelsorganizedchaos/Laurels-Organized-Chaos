            Starting over doesn’t always look like burning your whole life down, packing bags, or running toward some
            dramatic new beginning. Sometimes it’s quieter. Smaller. Slower. Sometimes it looks like sitting with yourself
            and realizing…
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            The thing that needs restarting isn’t your life — it’s you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not the you that’s been performing. Not the you shaped by other people’s expectations. Not the you you created
            to survive, to be loved, to avoid disappointing anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the real you. The one underneath all of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that’s the journey I’m on right now — a full internal “factory reset,” not because I’m broken, but because
            I’ve been carrying around too many versions of myself that were never actually me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m learning who I am again. Who I want to be. Who I was before the masks. Before survival mode. Before I started
            twisting myself into something more “acceptable,” more “useful,” more “perfect.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s uncomfortable. It’s vulnerable. It’s slow.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it’s working.

        <!-- Masks -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Masks We Forget We’re Wearing</h2>

          <p>
            I didn’t realize how many versions of myself I had built for other people until I finally stopped and let everything
            go quiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “strong one.”  
            The “put-together mom.”  
            The “cool girl who can handle anything.”  
            The “I’m fine, really.”  
            The “I don’t need help” version.  
            The “unbothered” version.  
            The “perfect partner” version.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of them were lies — they were just costumes I wore for so long that I forgot I could take them off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting over, for me, isn’t about becoming someone new.
            It’s about coming home to someone old. Someone original. Someone real.

        <!-- Therapy -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">The Therapy That Doesn’t Look Like Therapy</h2>

          <p>
            I’m in therapy now — real, ongoing, messy therapy — and honestly, the first few sessions didn’t feel like what I
            thought therapy was supposed to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was expecting worksheets, solutions, strategies, step-by-step “fix your life” plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, every session turned into me just… word vomiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything. All at once. Every messy thought. Every tangled feeling. Every unprocessed piece of my life spilling
            out of me in one long exhale.
          </p>
          <p>
            And for a minute, I thought:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            Is this even therapy? Should I get a new therapist?
          </p>
          <p>
            So I told her that. And she reminded me:
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the very first step in healing is simply letting someone hear you. Letting it all out so your brain
            finally stops holding its breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Word vomit,” she said, “is a method. Your mind is emptying the shelves so you can finally see what’s on them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And she was right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because after every session — every ramble, every unraveling — I leave feeling lighter. As if all the mess I’ve
            been carrying for years finally has somewhere else to sit besides my chest.
          </p>

        <!-- Slow rebuilding -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Slow, Intentional Rebuilding</h2>

          <p>
            The biggest thing I’m learning?
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting over doesn’t have to happen overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t have to be dramatic. It doesn’t have to be aesthetic. It doesn’t have to be bold or Instagram-worthy
            or perfectly packaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes starting over is quiet. Sometimes it’s choosing softness where you used to choose panic. Sometimes it’s
            choosing to respond instead of react. Sometimes it’s letting yourself breathe before you fix anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s slow. It’s intentional. It’s often invisible to everyone but you.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it counts. Every tiny shift counts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time I choose honesty over the mask — that’s starting over.  
            Every time I let myself feel instead of shutting down — that’s starting over.  
            Every time I choose the slower, softer way — that’s starting over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not reinventing my entire life right now. I’m rediscovering the parts of myself I abandoned while trying
            to be everything for everyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that soft, steady rebuilding? It feels more real than any dramatic restart ever could.
          </p>

        <!-- Closing -->
        <section class="post-section">
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Letting Yourself Start Over Without Violence</h2>

          <p>
            We’re so used to seeing “fresh starts” framed as huge, explosive moments — quitting everything, cutting everyone
            off, moving away, burning every bridge we’ve ever crossed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes that’s needed. Sometimes things really do need to end.
          </p>
          <p>
            But sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stay in your life.  
            Stay in your body.  
            Stay with your feelings.  
            Stay long enough to see who you could become if you stopped abandoning yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what this season is for me:
          </p>
          <p class="post-quote">
            A softer kind of starting over.  
            Less fire, more warmth.  
            Less self-destruction, more self-returning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not done. I don’t have it all figured out. But I’m finally giving myself permission to grow slowly, speak
            honestly, and rebuild gently.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if you’re here, reading this, maybe it’s your permission too.
